# To-Do Bot

## Discord Bot Configuration

This README file outlines how to set up your `example.env` for your Discord bot.

### Setup

First, rename the `example.env` file to `.env`.

Then, replace the configuration values in the `.env` file with your own:

- `token`: This is your Discord **TEST** bot's token. You can get this token from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers).
- `prodToken`: This is your Discord **PRODUCTION** bot's token. You can get this from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers).
- `mode`: Mode which the bot will be executed. Defaults to **dev**.
